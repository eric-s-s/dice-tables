.. py:module:: dicetables

Welcome to dicetables's documentation!
======================================

v4.0.3

dicetables is a module for getting all the combinations for any set of dice
and getting information from that data.

It generates the combinations by adding dice to a DiceTable or DetailedDiceTable.
You can get useful strings and calculations with EventsCalulations.

For some quick examples, see :doc:`the_basics`

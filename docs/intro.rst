Basic Math for Dice and Events
==============================

Basics of Dice and combinations
-------------------------------

Rolling two six-sided dice provides a good introduction to the
math behind die rolls.  Below are all the possible ways to roll 2D6
grouped by the total roll::

    _2: 1-1
     3: 1-2, 2-1
     4: 1-3, 3-1, 2-2
     5: 1-4, 4-1, 2-3, 3-2
     6: 1-5, 5-1, 2-4, 4-2, 3-3
     7: 1-6, 6-1, 2-5, 5-2, 3-4, 4-3
     8: 2-6, 6-2, 3-5, 5-3, 4-4
     9: 3-6, 6-3, 4-5, 5-4
    10: 4-6, 6-4, 5-5
    11: 5-6, 6-5,
    12: 6-6


There is only one way to roll a "2", but there are six ways to roll
a "7". There are a total of 36 different combinations on these two
sets of dice. That means that your chance of rolling a 2 is 1/36 while
your chance of rolling a 7 is 6/36.

You could test this with a quick piece of python code, like so::

    from random import randint

    def roll_six():
        return randint(1, 6)

    def ten_thousand_rolls_of_2d6():
        answer = {roll: 0 for roll in range(2, 13)}
        for _ in range(10000):
            roll1 = roll_six()
            roll2 = roll_six()
            total= roll1 + roll2
            answer[total] += 1
    return answer

    print(ten_thousand_rolls_of_2d6())

Running this scripts returned the following::

    {2: 317,
     3: 572,
     4: 813,
     5: 1135,
     6: 1349,
     7: 1635,
     8: 1417,
     9: 1123,
     10: 805,
     11: 548,
     12: 286}

Of the 10,000 rolls, 12 was rolled 286 times, or 2.8% (pretty close to 1/36).
7 happened about 16% of the time (pretty close to 6/36).

Events Dictionary
-----------------

While the above is great for visualization, it quickly becomes
unmanageable. Imagine mapping out all the totals for 3D6 (there
are 216 of them), or, even worse, having to keep track of 3 dice
of 3 different sizes.

Instead, use dictionary of events having {roll: number_of_times_it_occurs}. On a six-sided die, each
roll has an equal chance of occurring, so it's represented by the dictionary:
:code:`{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1}`.

To combine this with another six-sided die,
you iterate through each die roll and create a new dictionary. When the second die rolls a "1",
it bumps all the rolls up by one, making: :code:`{2: 1 ,3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}`. When
the second die rolls a "2" it bumps all the die rolls up by two, making:
:code:`{3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}`. Keep doing this for each roll and add them up.
::

    {2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1}
          {3: 1, 4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1}
                {4: 1, 5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1}
                      {5: 1, 6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 1}
                            {6: 1, 7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 1, 11: 1}
    +                             {7: 1, 8: 1, 9: 1, 10: 1, 11: 1, 12: 1}
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    {2: 1, 3: 2, 4: 3, 5: 4, 6: 5, 7: 6, 8: 5, 9: 4, 10: 3, 11: 2, 12: 1}

This dictionary of events is the spread of combinations for 2D6. It is the same as the other representation
in the previous section. "2" has one combination, "3" has two combinations and "7" has six combinations.

Using this method, adding another die to 2D6 becomes much more manageable. Simply take the
dictionary of 2D6 above, and for each roll of the next six-sided die, create a new dictionary of events.
So for a roll of 2, create the dictionary:
:code:`{2+2: 1, 3+2: 2, 4+2: 3, 5+2: 4, 6+2: 5, 7+2: 6, 8+2: 5, 9+2: 4, 10+2: 3, 11+2: 2, 12+2: 1}`
This makes::

    {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6:  4, 7:  5, 8:  6, 9:  5, 10:  4, 11:  3, 12:  2, 13:  1}
          {4: 1, 5: 2, 6:  3, 7:  4, 8:  5, 9:  6, 10:  5, 11:  4, 12:  3, 13:  2, 14:  1}
                {5: 1, 6:  2, 7:  3, 8:  4, 9:  5, 10:  6, 11:  5, 12:  4, 13:  3, 14:  2, 15:  1}
                      {6:  1, 7:  2, 8:  3, 9:  4, 10:  5, 11:  6, 12:  5, 13:  4, 14:  3, 15:  2, 16: 1}
                             {7:  1, 8:  2, 9:  3, 10:  4, 11:  5, 12:  6, 13:  5, 14:  4, 15:  3, 16: 2, 17: 1}
    +                               {8:  1, 9:  2, 10:  3, 11:  4, 12:  5, 13:  6, 14:  5, 15:  4, 16: 3, 17: 2, 18: 1}
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    {3: 1, 4: 3, 5: 6, 6: 10, 7: 15, 8: 21, 9: 25, 10: 27, 11: 27, 12: 25, 13: 21, 14: 15, 15: 10, 16: 6, 17: 3, 18: 1}


**Another example with 2D6:**

Take 2d6 and add a different die to it. This time, it's a weighted 2-sided die that rolls
"2" three times as often as "1".  This die is represented by the dictionary: :code:`{1: 1, 2: 3}`.
For the :code:`{1: 1, ...`, you add 1 to each roll in your 2D6 events, like so:
:code:`{3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6: 4, 7: 5, 8: 6, 9: 5, 10: 4, 11: 3, 12: 2, 13: 1}`.
For the :code:`..., 2: 3}`, you add two to the die rolls **three times**, and each time is:
:code:`{4: 1, 5: 2, 6: 3, 7: 4, 8: 5, 9: 6, 10: 5, 11: 4, 12: 3, 13: 2, 14: 1}`
this gives you::


    {3: 1, 4: 2, 5: 3, 6:  4, 7:  5, 8:  6, 9:  5, 10:  4, 11:  3, 12:  2, 13: 1}
          {4: 1, 5: 2, 6:  3, 7:  4, 8:  5, 9:  6, 10:  5, 11:  4, 12:  3, 13: 2, 14: 1}
          {4: 1, 5: 2, 6:  3, 7:  4, 8:  5, 9:  6, 10:  5, 11:  4, 12:  3, 13: 2, 14: 1}
    +     {4: 1, 5: 2, 6:  3, 7:  4, 8:  5, 9:  6, 10:  5, 11:  4, 12:  3, 13: 2, 14: 1}
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    {3: 1, 4: 5, 5: 9, 6: 13, 7: 17, 8: 21, 9: 23, 10: 19, 11: 15, 12: 11, 13: 7, 14: 3}

So if you rolled 2D6 and 1WeightedDie({1: 1, 2: 3}). You'd get the following distribution.
There are 144 total occurrences. 3 happens once, giving it a 0.69% chance, and 9 happens
23 times, giving you a 15.97% chance of rolling a 9.
